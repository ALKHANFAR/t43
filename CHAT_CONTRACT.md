# Siyadah chat contract — draft for the final frontend

This contract belongs to `ALKHANFAR/t43`. The customer frontend may change later; these meanings must remain stable across it. `77766` is not part of this path. This document describes the draft PR #13 API; external provider verification remains a separate integration gate.

## Request identity and company boundary

- The server derives `companyId` from the signed session. The browser does not choose a tenant or Activepieces project.
- A message supplies a stable `request_id` and `conversation_id`. Repeating **the same ID and content** reads the stored result; it does not dispatch again. Reusing the ID with different content or conversation returns 409.
- `op:work` with the same `request_id` reads status. A missing record and an uncertain recorded outcome both use `request_status:not_observed` today; the UI must say the result is unverified and must not retry with a new ID automatically.
- A *new* request ID is a new operation, even if the wording looks similar. The current `prior_request_id` field is not a cancellation guarantee.

## Meaning of response fields

| Field | Meaning | May prove an external action? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_status` | Whether Siyadah recorded and handled this request: `queued`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `not_observed` | No |
| `outcome_kind` | What kind of response was produced: `conversation_reply`, `employee_draft`, `external_run`, `unverified` | Only identifies the kind; proof is separate |
| `work_status` | Legacy progress/status field; `not_started` for a reply or disabled employee draft | Never by itself |
| `work_id` | Identifier for status tracking; a `request_…` value is not a provider run | No |
| `recent_work[].runId` | Activepieces run reference | Proves a run reference, not a provider outcome |
| `transport_receipt` | Optional scoped run ID and HTTP status for a response whose business outcome is still unverified | Proves transport only; never success |

### Cases the frontend must distinguish

| Case | Contract | Customer wording |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary answer | `request_status:succeeded`, `outcome_kind:conversation_reply`, `work_status:not_started` | The answer was returned; no tool run is implied. |
| Employee saved | `request_status:succeeded`, `outcome_kind:employee_draft`, `work_status:not_started`, `employee.status:disabled`, `employee.flowId:null` until prepared | The employee is saved in Siyadah; its tools and runnable flow are not ready and it has not acted. |
| Uncertain outcome | `request_status:not_observed`, `outcome_kind:unverified`, `work_status:unknown` | The result is unverified; check the same request ID. |
| Rejected before dispatch | `request_status:failed`, `outcome_kind:unverified`, `work_status:failed`, no `transport_receipt` | The employee's task did not start. |
| Tool response without business proof | `request_status:not_observed`, `work_status:unknown`, optional `transport_receipt` | The tool replied, but the result is still being verified; do not dispatch again automatically. |
| External flow | `outcome_kind:external_run` plus scoped `runId` and execution record | Show only the level actually verified. Activepieces run success alone is not proof of the provider result or business impact. |

For a provider result, require a terminal scoped run, the relevant step output, and validation specific to that tool. A provider outcome must be read back separately before the UI says it succeeded. A customer-visible result and a KPI need their own evidence. Draft PR #14 currently updates unknown-result wording; further frontend work must reflect `not_started` before either PR is merged.

Saving an employee draft requires the company database and does not provision Activepieces. A later preparation path must attach a company-owned flow to the saved employee ID, validate its tools, and then enable execution. A saved draft alone must never be described as execution-ready or activated.

## Release boundary

This file is a contract draft. PR #13, its dependent UI PR #14, and the Activepieces verification slice must be reviewed together before a final frontend is bound to them. Merging PR #13 into Railway's connected branch may trigger a production deploy and schema initialization; follow the documented release gate first.
